This Github repository contains a shell script that obtains data from a dataset of CBS.

External users can find this shell script here and can run it on the cbs dataset about crime and migrant background. It selects data about the total and relative crime suspects of groups of different backgrounds from the years 2010 through 2014. It outputs this data with some info about what is displayed so it can easily be used for research.

The data used: CBS Verdachten; geslacht, leeftijd, migratieachtergrond en generatie dataset. I have an offline version of the dataset stored. It can be found and downloaded on https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=nl&_catalog=CBS&tableId=81959NED**

**The download consists of too much cells to download, so if it can not be downloaded due to that, select only the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014
